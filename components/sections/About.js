                i there! Iâ€™m Achem Habib Nomaer, and I'm from Bangladesh. Even
                though my background is in Biotechnology, my true passion lies
                in coding and creating websites. It all started as a hobby, but
                now it's become my biggest love! I've been teaching myself how
                to make websites, and let me tell you, it's been quite the
                adventure.
              </p>

              <p className="mt-4">
                While I'm still pretty new to the professional world, I'm super
                excited to keep learning and growing. I believe that every
                challenge is an opportunity to get better, and I can't wait to
                see where this coding journey takes me. Let's connect and create
                some cool stuff together!
